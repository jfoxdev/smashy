Smashy!
=======

Smashy! is a breakout clone written in Love2D.  I wrote it in a weekend as a submission for Lawless Jam (http://reddit.com/r/lawlessjam).

Included audio track is Obeck - Clazzic, found on http://soundcloud.com.
Included menu audio is unused, but something I wrote a few months back.
The sound effects were made with my mouth and Audacity.
